Here's what I've seen work for people who take a systematic approach:

**Structured Focus Sessions**

1. Choose one specific outcome you want
2. Set a 25-minute boundary 
3. Work within that constraint
4. Take a genuine break when it ends
5. Repeat 3-4 cycles, then step back

The constraint isn't arbitrary - it acknowledges that sustained attention is a finite resource. You're designing a system that works with your cognitive architecture, not against it.

Want to refine this approach based on what you know about your own patterns?`;

**Direct Professional Communication**

Subject: [Specific reference to your actual conversation]

[Name],

Circling back on [the specific thing you discussed]. Key points:

- [Actual point with context]
- [Next actual point]
- [What needs clarification or action]

[Your clear ask or next step]

[Your name]

The structure works because it's honest about what happened and what needs to happen next. Want to adapt this for your specific situation?`;

Here's a framework that respects your judgment:

**Intentional Daily Design**

1. Identify 3 outcomes that would make today worthwhile
2. Sequence them based on your energy and constraints
3. Build in decision points to evaluate and adjust

This isn't about productivity optimization - it's about conscious choice-making. You're the architect of how you spend your attention.

What aspects of your current approach are you most interested in examining?`;
