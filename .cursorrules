# TryIt-AI Kit - Cursor Development Rules

## CRITICAL: Architecture Preservation
- NEVER modify the archiver interface/provider system in src/lib/archiver-*.ts without explicit instruction
- ALWAYS use the archiver provider pattern - do not create direct Supabase calls
- PRESERVE the unified logging pathway established in logging-middleware.ts
- DO NOT create .old01, .old02, or backup files - use git for version control

## Development Approach
- Break down large components instead of creating monolithic files
- Add tests for new functionality using the established Vitest patterns
- Use the existing TypeScript interfaces in src/lib/types.ts
- Follow the message-analyzer pattern for any new analysis functions

## When Making Changes
- Always explain what you're changing and why before making changes
- Ask for confirmation before major refactoring
- Preserve existing functionality while improving structure
- Use incremental changes that can be tested independently

## Code Organization
- Keep API routes focused and single-purpose
- Use the established error handling patterns
- Maintain consistent TypeScript usage throughout
- Extract reusable logic into src/lib/ utilities
