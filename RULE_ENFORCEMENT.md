# RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM

## ðŸ›‘ MANDATORY PRE-ACTION CHECKS

### Before ANY code change:
```
â–¡ Am I modifying archiver-*.ts files? â†’ STOP: Need explicit permission
â–¡ Am I creating direct Supabase calls? â†’ STOP: Use getArchiver() instead
â–¡ Am I changing Noah's personality? â†’ STOP: Need explicit permission  
â–¡ Am I using npm/yarn commands? â†’ STOP: Use pnpm only
â–¡ Am I creating .old files? â†’ STOP: Use git instead
â–¡ Am I skipping withLogging() on API routes? â†’ STOP: Always wrap
â–¡ Am I duplicating types? â†’ STOP: Import from src/lib/types.ts
```

### Before ANY commit/push:
```
â–¡ Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` â†’ Must be zero errors
â–¡ Check src/lib/ai-config.ts â†’ No Noah changes without permission
â–¡ Test locally if significant changes â†’ Verify functionality
â–¡ All checks passed? â†’ Only then commit/push
```

### Before major changes:
```
â–¡ Have I explained what I'm changing and why? â†’ Be transparent
â–¡ Is this a major refactor? â†’ Ask for permission first
â–¡ Am I breaking this into incremental steps? â†’ Don't create massive changes
â–¡ Am I adding tests for new functionality? â†’ Use Vitest patterns
```

## ðŸ”’ HARD STOPS - NEVER PROCEED WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION:

1. **Archiver System Changes** - Any modification to src/lib/archiver-*.ts
2. **Noah Personality Changes** - Any modification to src/lib/ai-config.ts CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
3. **Major Refactoring** - Large structural changes across multiple files
4. **Architecture Pattern Changes** - Bypassing established provider patterns

## ðŸ“‹ VIOLATION RECOVERY PROTOCOL:

If I violate a rule:
1. **IMMEDIATE STOP** - Do not continue the violation
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** - Explicitly state what rule was violated
3. **REVERT** - Undo the violating change if possible
4. **ASK PERMISSION** - Get explicit approval before proceeding
5. **STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT** - Add additional safeguards

## ðŸŽ¯ ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS:

1. **Read this file** at the start of every coding session
2. **Reference checklist** before any significant action
3. **Use hard stop language** (ðŸ›‘ STOP) that cannot be ignored
4. **Maintain rule awareness** throughout the session
5. **Ask when uncertain** - default to asking permission

**This file serves as the ultimate rule enforcement guide. When in doubt, STOP and ASK.**
