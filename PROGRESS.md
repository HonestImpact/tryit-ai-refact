# Freedom Expander MVP – Repair Progress Log

This document is updated at each milestone so you can track what changed and what is next.

## Phase 1 – Consolidate types and analyzer (IN PROGRESS)

Completed
- Added canonical shared types
  - src/lib/types.ts (TrackType, SanitizedMessage, ConversationLog, ArtifactLog, ArchiveStats)
- Added unified analyzer utilities
  - src/lib/message-analyzer.ts (sanitizeContent, analyzeMessage, determineTrack, identifyConversationPattern, identifyArtifactType)
- Refactored FS archiver to use shared modules
  - Updated: src/lib/archiver.ts (imports analyzer + types; removed duplicate logic)
- Refactored Supabase archiver imports
  - Updated: src/lib/supabase-archiver.ts (uses message-analyzer)
- Backwards compatibility
  - Updated: src/lib/data-sanitization.ts now re-exports from message-analyzer

Next
- Quick scan for any remaining direct use of data-sanitization (should be covered by re-export).
- Move to Phase 2.

## Phase 2 – Archiver interface + provider + middleware refactor (PLANNED)

Plan
- Create src/lib/archiver-interface.ts with a single contract:
  - logConversation, logArtifact, getRecentLogs, getConversationAnalytics, getTrackEffectiveness, getMicroToolEffectiveness
- Create src/lib/archiver-provider.ts to choose backend by environment
  - Default: Filesystem locally; Supabase on hosted; optional dual logging via ARCHIVER_DUAL_LOG=true
- Update src/lib/logging-middleware.ts to use the provider (one callsite, no double logging logic)

## Verification
You can inspect changes via git:

```
 git status
 git diff
```

Open these files for the latest changes:
- src/lib/types.ts
- src/lib/message-analyzer.ts
- src/lib/archiver.ts
- src/lib/supabase-archiver.ts
- src/lib/data-sanitization.ts

## Notes
- No behavioral changes intended in Phase 1; Consolidation only.
- If any schema/env mismatches surface during Phase 2, work will pause and notes will be added here.
